    "text": "4. Code Examples in DAX\n1. Total Sales Calculation\nExplanation:\nThis formula calculates the total sales of all restaurants using the SUM() function. It helps understand overall revenue in the dataset.\n```DAX Total Sales = SUM(RestaurantData[Sales])\n2. Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth Calculation\nExplanation:\nThis formula compares sales growth between two years to track business performance.\n```DAX YOY Growth = ([Current Year Sales] - [Previous Year Sales]) / [Previous Year Sales] * 100\n3. Ranking Restaurants Based on Sales\nExplanation:\nThis formula ranks restaurants based on their sales performance using the RANKX() function.\n```DAX Sales Rank = RANKX(ALL(RestaurantData), RestaurantData[Sales], , DESC, DENSE)\n4. Creating a Profit Margin Column\nExplanation:\nIf we have profit and sales data, we can calculate the profit margin using DIVIDE() to avoid division errors.\n```DAX Profit Margin = DIVIDE(RestaurantData[Profit], RestaurantData[Sales])\n5. Filtering High Sales Restaurants\nExplanation:\nTo analyze only top-performing restaurants, we filter those with sales above ₹1,00,000 using FILTER().\n```DAX High Sales = FILTER(RestaurantData, RestaurantData[Sales] &gt; 100000)\n6. Average Sales per Restaurant\nExplanation:\nhis gives the average sales value.\n```DAX Average Sales = AVERAGE(RestaurantData[Sales])"

Conclusion\nPower BI helps in data analysis by providing powerful visualizations and easy-to-use dashboards and even simplify the process of data handling although its main functionality is data analysis. Through this assignment, we:\n1. Installed and set up Power BI. 2. Imported a dataset and created interactive charts. 3. Used DAX formulas for calculations. 4. Applied filters to refine insights.\nPower BI is an essential tool for data-driven decision-making!"
